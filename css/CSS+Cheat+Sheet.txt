Cascading Style Sheets: at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class             - Several elements can have the same class
#id                - Similar to class, but each id can only be used once
*                  - This will apply to all elements
element            - 
element, element   - Both elements will have the properties
element1 element2  - All element2 that are nested inside element1 will have the properties (element1 will not have the properties)
element1 > element2  - All element2 whose direct parent is element1 will have the properties (element1 will not have the peoperties)
element1 + element2    - Select all element2 that comes exactly after element1 (dont confuse with e1 > e2)
element:hover         - The properties will only be applied when you hover over it
element:last-child    - Selects all elements that are the last clild of some other element
:first-child          - Selects all elements that are the first child of some other element
!important (not recommended)


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
